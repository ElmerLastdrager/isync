[0.4]

Added MaxSize configuration option to limit downloading of new messages from
the server to less than some threshold.

More robust --fast option works without using \Recent flags, so the previous
problem with multiple accesses killing these flags is no longer a problem.

RFC2060 obsoleted RFC822.PEEK, use BODY.PEEK[] instead which does the same
job.

Don't need to request UID in a FETCH when doing UID FETCH (RFC2060 states
that its automatically returned).

[0.3]

Fixed to clean up temp maildir files when the fetch of a new message failed.

Fixed to not assume order of the flags returned by "UID FETCH"

Added support for building RPMs.

[0.2]

SSL support added.

[0.1]

Initial release.
