	* sync.c:
	display how many messages were fetched from the server

	* imap.c:

	* imap.c:
	use imap_close to terminate a connection in imap_open()

	* imap.c, isync.1, isync.h, maildir.c, main.c:
	allow leading whitespace in config files

	now possible to sync multiple mailboxes by specifying multiple aliases on

	* README, imap.c, isync.1, isync.h, main.c:
	isync-brokenservers.diff (Jeremy Katz <katzj@linuxpower.org>)
	adds support for disabling NAMESPACE, and disable various flavors of TLS/SSL
	for use with some broken IMAP servers.

	* imap.c, sync.c:
	prompt user if they wish to continue if the server's X.509 certificate can't
	be verified.

	sync_mailbox should consider uid == 0 to be "unknown"

	* main.c, sync.c:
	fixed sync_mailbox() to correctly write new messages to the local maildir
	box (Thomas Roessler <roessler@does-not-exist.org>)

	* main.c: set default MaxSize to 0 (unlimited)

	invert test for password being set after getpass() call (Magnus Jonsson
	<bigfoot@acc.umu.se>)

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, configure.in, imap.c, isync.1, isync.h, maildir.c, main.c, sample.isyncrc, sync.c:

	fixed --fast to work robustly without relying on the \Recent flag in
	messages

	* imap.c, isync.h, maildir.c, sync.c:
	RFC822.PEEK is obsolete in RFC2060.  Use BODY.PEEK[] instead, which does
	the same thing

	keep track of the uidvalidity so isync can detect if the mailbox on the
	server has changed since the last sync.

	* NEWS: updated NEWS for 0.3 release

	added support for building RPMS

	* Makefile.am, isync.1:

	first `{' to find the message size.

	* isync.1, sync.c:
	added BUGS section to manpage detailing the fact that we break the
	maildir(5) spec by parsing the filename

	change message delivery to use the method described in maildir(5)

	* configure.in, main.c, sync.c:
	use getpass() to get the user's password

	unlink the temp file if we are unable to fetch a new message from the
	server.

	update version to 0.3

	* isync.1: fixed typo in man page for --verbose option

	* Makefile.am, README, TODO, imap.c, isync.h, list.c:
